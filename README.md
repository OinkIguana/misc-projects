# misc-projects
Some small random projects I have. Various different languages.

Nothing really useful or particularly good, but they're just little things that I play with now and then.

== Sudoku Solver ==

Done in HTML/JavaScript. It solves only simple sudoku puzzles, but maybe I hope to make it smarter eventually.

== Math ==

A JavaScript library of various functions to make my math homework a little easier.

== Cat == 

It's a piece of PHP code that I shaped into a cat. Doesn't do a lot, but it does actually run.

== Scribbler ==

Scribbles randomly, with random colours. Can be directed slightly by clicking in the direction you don't want the head to go.
